== Predeployment steps

This Quick Start requires a Citrix Cloud tenant with an active trial or a paid subscription to the Citrix DaaS service. If you don't have a subscription, https://www.citrix.com/products/citrix-cloud/form/inquiry/[contact a Citrix representative].

=== Create a Secure Client

After you obtain a DaaS subscription, create a secure client in your Citrix Cloud tenant.

. Sign in to the https://citrix.cloud.com/[Citrix Cloud management console^].
. Choose the API Access tab. Go to https://us.cloud.com/identity/api-access[API Access^].
. Note the customer ID.

. Enter a client name.
. Choose **Create Client**.
. Download the following information from the pop-up window:
** **Secure Client ID** – This value looks something like `c0xbc290-20c4-e96e-9f69-69b4526edf5d`. The value is shown under Id at the time of creation, and you can retrieve it later by going to the Identify and Access Management page.
** **Secure Client Secret** – This value looks something like `jPcBJmYtBndMI1R-p420Gw==`, and it is shown only at the time of creation.



When you create the Secure Client, you need to record the Customer ID, the Secure Client ID, and the Secure Client Secret. These three pieces of information will be used by the Quick Start template.
