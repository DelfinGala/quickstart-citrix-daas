.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/citrix-daas-architecture.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Remote Desktop Gateway in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Remote Desktop access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory deployed in both Availability Zones for redundancy.
** Two Citrix Cloud Connectors (domain-joined Windows servers) running on EC2 instances, deployed in both Availability Zones for redundancy.
** A Windows Server with the Citrix Virtual Delivery Agent (VDA) installed, running on an EC2 instance.

This Quick Start also performs the following in your Citrix Cloud tenant:
* Configures the two Citrix Cloud Connector instances to form a resource location on AWS.
* Creates an AWS hosting connection and resource.
* Creates a machine catalog, and adds the VDA instance to the machine catalog.
* Creates a Delivery Group, including a hosted shared desktop and two sample published applications.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
