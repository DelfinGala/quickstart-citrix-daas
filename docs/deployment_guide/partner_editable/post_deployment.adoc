== Postdeployment steps

=== Deployment ID
Each Quick Start deployment of the Citrix DaaS on AWS generates and uses a four-character Deployment ID. This ID is used in either the name or description of many of the resources the Quick Start template creates.
//In the following figures, notice that the Deployment ID is *0ew8*.

==== EC2 Instances
The Quick Start deploys the following EC2 instances in your AWS account:

* One Remote Desktop Gateway host (RD Gateway)
* Two Citrix Cloud Connectors
* One Citrix Virtual Delivery Agent (VDA)

==== Connect to the Bastion Host (RD Gateway)
Most of the EC2 instances created by this Quick Start do not have a public IP address. To connect to these instances, use the RD Gateway.

. Log in to the RD Gateway instance by opening a Remote Desktop Connection to the *BastionHostEIP* address shown on the Outputs tab.
. Use the value of *DomainAdmin* as the user name, and use the value of *DomainAdminPassword* as the password. Note that the RD Gateway has a public IP address, but the other instances have private IP addresses.
. Connect to the RD Gateway instance over the internet by using Remote Desktop, then use Remote Desktop on the RD Gateway to connect to the other EC2 instances.  You can find the private IP addresses of the Citrix Cloud Connector and VDA instances by selecting the respective EC2 instance in the AWS Console.

==== Explore the Resources Created in Your Citrix Cloud Tenant
This Quick Start creates resources in your Citrix Cloud tenant, many of which you can customize. To access them, log into the https://citrix.cloud.com/[Citrix Cloud management console^]. This Quick Start creates a resource location for each deployment. The resource location follows a standard naming convention and includes the Deployment ID to make it unique.

[#postdeploy1]
.Quick Start Citrix resource location

Note that the resource location contains the two Citrix Cloud Connector instances created by the Quick Start template.

[#postdeploy2]
.Quick Start Citrix Cloud Connectors

When a resource location is created, the Active Directory to which the Citrix Cloud Connectors are joined is automatically added to the list of available domains in the Citrix Cloud tenant. To see this list of domains in the Citrix Cloud management console, choose *Identity and Access Management*, and then choose https://us.cloud.com/identity/domains[Domains^].

You can see that the `qstest.com forest/domain` (the name chosen for this Quick Start sample deployment) is now available in the Citrix Cloud tenant.

To provision and manage the VDA with the Citrix DaaS, this Quick Start template creates a Hosting Connection and a Hosting Resource in your environment. For more information, refer to https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/install-configure/connections.html[Create and manage connections^].

[#postdeploy4]

This Quick Start creates one VDA deployed to a single Windows Server 2016 EC2 instance. Virtual applications and desktops are installed to and delivered from this EC2 instance.

This Quick Start template creates one manually provisioned, power-managed machine catalog based on Windows Server 2016. Machine catalogs typically contain one or more identically configured VDAs that share the properties of the machine catalog. For more information, refer to https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/install-configure/machine-catalogs-create.html[Create machine catalogs^].

[#postdeploy5]

The Quick Start template adds the VDA instance it creates to the machine catalog it creates.

[#postdeploy6]

This Quick Start template creates one Delivery Group, which is available to all authenticated users. Virtual applications and desktops are defined by Delivery Groups. Delivery Groups have a number of attributes associated with them, including Apps, Desktops, users, and machine catalogs. For more information, refer to https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/install-configure/delivery-groups-create.html[Create delivery groups^].

This Quick Start template also defines two sample applications and a published desktop, delivered from the machine catalog.

=== Test Your Citrix DaaS Deployment

This Quick Start template is designed to create a fully functional deployment. After the deployment is complete, you should be able to navigate to the Citrix Workspace for your Citrix Cloud tenant, log in with appropriate credentials, and connect to the published applications or desktop.

To test your deployment, first identify the URL of your Citrix Workspace. In the Citrix Cloud management console, choose https://us.cloud.com/workspaceconfiguration/access[Workspace Configuration^]. The Workspace URL will look something like the following:

[#postdeploy10]
.Citrix Cloud Workspace URL
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/workspace_url.png[workspace_url]

This URL can be used by either the Citrix Workspace app or a web browser to access Citrix DaaS created by this Quick Start template. After you are connected, log in with a valid Active Directory user:

[#postdeploy11]
.Citrix Cloud Workspace login
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/workspace_login.png[workspace_login]

After you log in, you will see the two sample published apps and an AWS QuickStart Desktop.

== Customizing Your Citrix DaaS Deployment on AWS
This Quick Start deploys a reference architecture that can be customized. As you’ve seen here, this Quick Start template creates a fully functional system in about 90
minutes, but you need to customize the Delivery Group to match the organization’s needs. You can also install additional applications on the VDA by remotely connecting to the instance as an administrator.

Common next steps and system customizations include:

* Modifying published applications or desktops (to remove defaults, add new apps, filter access to the resources by Active Directory user or group, etc.). This can be done on the Manage tab of Citrix DaaS in the Citrix Cloud management console. The Delivery Group properties are a great place to start.
* Configuring https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/manage-deployment/user-profiles.html[Citrix User Profile Management^]. Citrix DaaS includes a component called User Profile Management (UPM), which allows you to manage roaming user profiles in a high-performance, flexible manner. For more information on use cases and configuration of Citrix UPM.
* Provisioning and configuring the https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/workspace-environment-management/service.html[Citrix Workspace Environment Manager^] service. The Citrix Workspace Environment Manager service uses intelligent resource management and User Profile Management technologies to deliver competitive performance, desktop logon, and application response times for Citrix DaaS deployments. It is a software-only, driver-free solution, requiring only a lightweight agent to be installed on your VDA.
* Creating a https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/install-configure/machine-catalogs-create.html#prepare-a-master-image-on-the-hypervisor-or-cloud-service[master image^] VDA template instance, and deploying any number of additional instances based on the master image with Machine Creation Services. This is a more complex process, but it allows you to provision and version-manage instances at scale.
* Deploying https://www.citrix.com/networking/[advanced networking capabilities^] into the system. Citrix is also an provider of networking services, including a mix of sophisticated networking appliances and networking-related web services. You might be interested in one or more of the following:
